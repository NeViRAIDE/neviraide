# NEVIRAIDE

## Fast, comfortable and light IDE

### This is my setup of NEOVIM

**_Remember that it's only modifications of config files and collect of different plugins.
Vim/Neovim is a FREEDOM.
You can setup your own IDE or simple text editor.
You need only define what you want and what you need._**
